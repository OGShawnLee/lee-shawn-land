				I am a software engineer with a passion for building web applications. I have experience in
				various programming languages and frameworks, and I enjoy learning new technologies. In my
				free time, I like to work on personal projects.

        I enjoy learning about the Roman Empire and its history. I find it fascinating how they
        managed to build such a vast empire and how their culture and influence still impact us
        today. I also love to read about the history of the world and how it has shaped our
        present. I believe that understanding history is essential to understanding our world and
        the people in it.

        I am also a fan of dark, futuristic aesthetics. I love the combination of dark colors and sleek designs that create a
        mysterious and intriguing atmosphere. I find it inspiring and motivating to work in an
        environment that reflects my personal style and interests. I believe that our surroundings
        can greatly influence our creativity and productivity, and I strive to create a workspace
        that inspires me to do my best work.
